# Library Catalog Management System
> CSC 307 (Data Structures) Semester Project

The Library Catalog Management System is a desktop application written in C++ using the Qt framework for the user interface. It allows users to efficiently manage a library catalog by adding, modifying, removing, and searching for books. The system uses a B-tree for fast in-memory operations and SQLite for persistent data storage.
